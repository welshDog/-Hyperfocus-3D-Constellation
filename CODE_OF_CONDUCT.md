# 🤝 Code of Conduct

## 💜 **Our Pledge**

**We are building the most welcoming, neurodivergent-friendly community on GitHub.**

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- 🧠 **Neurodivergence** - ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and all neurotypes  
- ♿ **Disability** - Physical, cognitive, sensory, or invisible disabilities
- 🌈 **Identity** - Age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- 💭 **Communication style** - Different ways of processing and expressing thoughts

**Different minds build different (better) solutions.** We celebrate neurodiversity as a strength, not something to be "fixed."

## 🧠 **Neurodivergent-Specific Guidelines**

### **💬 Communication Best Practices**

#### **For ADHD Minds** 🎯

- **Be direct and specific** - avoid vague requests

#### **For Autistic Contributors** 🌈
- **Be explicit rather than implicit** - clear expectations help everyone
- **Respect routine and structure** - consistent processes are valuable
- **Appreciate attention to detail** - thorough feedback is a gift

## 📝 **Enforcement Responsibilities**

### **Community Leaders**
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### **Scope**
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

### **Enforcement Process**

#### **Step 1: Direct Resolution** 🤝
- Try to resolve conflicts directly and respectfully when possible
- Assume good intentions - many issues stem from misunderstandings
- Consider neurodivergent communication differences before escalating

#### **Step 2: Community Leader Involvement** 👥
If direct resolution doesn't work:
- Contact community leaders privately
- Provide clear, specific examples of the behavior
- Suggest what outcome you'd like to see

#### **Step 3: Formal Review** 🔍
For serious violations:
- Community leaders will investigate promptly and fairly
- All parties will have opportunity to share their perspective  
- Decision will consider neurodivergent communication differences
- Focus will be on education and community repair when possible

### **Consequences**

#### **1. Correction** ✏️
**Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
**Consequence:** Private, written warning with clarity about the violation and explanation of why behavior was inappropriate. Public apology may be requested.

#### **2. Warning** ⚠️
**Impact:** Violation through single incident or series of actions.
**Consequence:** Warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved people for specified period. This includes unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. Violating these terms may lead to temporary or permanent ban.

#### **3. Temporary Ban** ⏸️
**Impact:** Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
**Consequence:** Temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for specified period. No public or private interaction with involved people during this period. Violating these terms may lead to permanent ban.

#### **4. Permanent Ban** 🚫
**Impact:** Demonstrating pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of individuals, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
**Consequence:** Permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## 🎯 **Special Considerations for Neurodivergent Community**

### **Misunderstandings vs. Misconduct**
We recognize that neurodivergent communication styles can sometimes be misinterpreted:

- **Direct communication** may seem "rude" to some but is often just efficient
- **Intense focus** on details may seem "nitpicky" but shows deep care
- **Different social cues** may lead to unintended social friction
- **Processing differences** may cause delayed responses or different participation styles

**Our approach:**
1. **Assume good intentions** first
2. **Educate rather than punish** when possible
3. **Consider neurodivergent perspectives** in all decisions
4. **Focus on impact AND intent** - both matter

### **Accommodations**
We provide accommodations for community participation:

- **Extended response times** for those who need processing time
- **Multiple communication channels** - text, voice, video, etc.
- **Structured interaction formats** - clear agendas, predictable patterns
- **Sensory considerations** - content warnings, reduced notifications
- **Alternative participation methods** - written instead of verbal, async instead of real-time
