## ðŸŒŸ Additional Notes

This project was created by and for the neurodivergent community. 

**We encourage:**
- âœ… Commercial use in accessible products
- âœ… Educational use in schools and universities  
- âœ… Open source derivatives that maintain accessibility
- âœ… Contributions from neurodivergent developers

**Special Recognition:**
This codebase represents hundreds of hours of neurodivergent innovation, 
proving that different minds build different (better) solutions.

**Attribution:**
If you use this in your projects, we'd love a shoutout to the 
Hyperfocus Zone community! ðŸ’œ
