## 🧠 **What Makes This Special**

Traditional portfolio sites are boring static grids. **This is different.**

This isn't just another GitHub showcase—it's a **living 3D galaxy** where your repositories exist as glowing, interactive celestial bodies. Every star tells a story, every orbit reveals connections, every interaction is designed for how ADHD and neurodivergent minds actually work.

**🎯 The Mission:** Prove that accessibility doesn't limit innovation—it enhances it.
